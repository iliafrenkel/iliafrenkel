I am a cybersecurity engineer, DevOps engineer and quality assurance engineer.
I like everything containers (not k8s though), and at the moment, I'm into Golang.
I'm looking for some help with Go, either mentoring or learning together. If you
are keen, come to [go-pb repo](https://github.com/iliafrenkel/go-pb) and join me.
I'm open to other suggestions too.

The best way to contact me is ğŸ“§frenkel.ilia@gmail.com.
My [LindkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iliafrenkel/) will work too.
If you are in Melbourne and want to chat over a coffee or a beer, drop me a note.
