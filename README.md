### G'day ğŸ‘‹, I am Ilia Frenkel, nice to meet you.
He/Him / ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º / ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡± / ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º /

I am a cybersecurity engineer, devops engineer and a quality assurance engineer.
I like everything containers (not k8s though) and at the moment I'm into Golang.
I'm looking for some help with Go, either mentoring or learning together. If you
are keen come to [go-pb repo](https://github.com/iliafrenkel/go-pb) and join me.

The best way to contact me is ğŸ“§frenkel.ilia@gmail.com.
My [LindkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iliafrenkel/) will work too.
If you are in Melbourne and want to have a chat over coffee or beer, drop me a
note.
