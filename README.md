I am a cybersecurity engineer, DevOps engineer and quality assurance engineer.
I like everything containers (not k8s, though), and at the moment, I'm into Golang.
I'm looking for some help with Go, either mentoring or learning together. Come to
[go-pb repo](https://github.com/iliafrenkel/go-pb) and join me if you are keen.
I'm open to other suggestions too.

The best way to contact me is ğŸ“§me@iliaf.net.
My [LindkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iliafrenkel/) will work too.
I am also on <a rel="me" href="https://infosec.exchange/@iliaf">Mastodon</a>.
If you are in Melbourne and want to chat over a coffee or a beer, drop me a note.
